## Starting the dev server

Make sure you have the latest Stable or LTS version of Node.js installed.

1. `git clone https://github.com/KleoPetroff/react-webpack-boilerplate.git`
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the dev server using `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:6600](http://localhost:6600)

## Available Commands

- `npm start` - start the dev server
- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder
- `npm run build` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint check
- `npm test` - run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode
- `npm run coverage` - generate code coverage report in the `coverage` folder

## Code Coverage

The project is using the Jest Code Coverage tool. The reports are generated by running `npm run coverage`. All configurations are located in `package.json`, inside the `jest` object.

The coverage report consists of an HTML reporter, which can be viewed in the browser and some helper coverage files like the coverage json and xml file.

## Production code

Run `npm run build`. The production-ready code will be located under `dist` folder. You can test the build by running `npm run start:prod` and loading the app by opening [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)
